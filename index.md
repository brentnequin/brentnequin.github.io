# Hi, my name is Brent.

I am a recent graduate from the University of Illinois at Chicago with a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering. My technical interests include machine learning, neural networks, algorithm design, and convex optimization. I love to program and play guitar. You can read more about me on my [about](http://brentnequin.com/about/)) page.

Sometimes I enjoy writting posts about some of the things I am interested in on my [blog](http://blog.brentnequin.com).

Sometimes I spend my time working on [projects](http://brentnequin.com/projects/) to sharpen my programming skills.
